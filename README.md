# WardleyMaps
A collection of #WardleyMaps on a variety of subjects I'm interested...from Aerospace, Sustainability, managing my Eve Online objectives...

## Groups of Maps
[Aviation](aviation): General thoughts on Aerospace and Defence

[LEF Ways And Means - Defence](LEFWaysAndMeansDefence): Maps created as part of the Defence working group of Simon's Ways and Means Of Industrialisation Research 2020-2021. Currently mostly in png, if time and motivation allows I will migrate to owm

## Collaborating
These maps are offered with CC BY-NC-SA

They are either
- .owa files for use with @MapsOnline (or the VSCode OnlineMaps plugin)
- .png files, which have embedded DrawIO (and can be editied if imported into DrawIO)
